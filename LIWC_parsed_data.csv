Nadine Hachach-Haram,"Surgeon, entrepreneur","If you're undergoing surgery, you want the best surgical team to collaborate on your case, no matter where they are. Surgeon and entrepreneur Nadine Hachach-Haram is developing a new system that helps surgeons operate together and train one another on new techniques -- from remote locations using low-cost augmented reality tools. Watch the system in action as she joins a surgeon in Minnesota performing a knee surgery, live on her laptop from the TED stage in New Orleans. As Hachach-Haram says: ""Through simple, everyday devices that we take for granted, we can really do miraculous things.""

G.T. Bynum,"Mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma","Conventional wisdom says that to win an election, you need to play to your constituencies' basest, most divisive instincts.

In a hopeful, funny talk, Bynum shares how he's tackling his city's most pressing issues and says that we need to set aside philosophical disagreements and focus on the aspirations that unite us.",1942,54.41,86.93,35.97,58.9,22.07,20.24,84.24,54.74,16.58,8.08,0.93,3.45,1.7,0.93,1.08,8.5,6.44,13.59,7.98,5.46,7.62,1.34,13.34,3.66,2.32,2.27,1.08,1.39,3.71,2.68,0.93,0,0.31,0.15,11.12,0.31,0.26,0.05,1.08,10.3,2.06,2.16,1.7,1.91,0.93,2.73,0.67,0.46,0.05,0.1,0.62,0.15,0.26,0.05,0.05,11.48,4.63,2.88,2.99,2.11,0.31,4.63,8.6,0.67,15.76,2.83,7.72,5.36,4.33,0.46,0.51,0.72,0.21,0.05,0.21,0.05,0,0.05,0.1,0,4.38,6.95,0,0.26,0.36,0.05,0.93,2.21,1.13,0.21,1.54,0.15,0.21,0.05,0,0.56,0,0.31,0.05,0,0,0.21,3.3,2.27,0.93,0,0.41,0.1,4.11,3.08,0.92,0,0.21,0.21,1.89,1.05,0.63,0,0.21,0,4.67,3.46,1.22,0,0.61,0.2,3.28,2.05,1.23,0,0.41,0.41,4.95,4.12,0.62,0,0,0,0.36,0.05,0,0.56,0.36,0.81,-0.01,0.82,3.07,-0.01,3.08,1,2,2

Justin Baldoni,"Actor, filmmaker, social entrepreneur","Justin Baldoni wants to start a dialogue with men about redefining masculinity -- to figure out ways to be not just good men but good humans. In a warm, personal talk, he shares his effort to reconcile who he is with who the world tells him a man should be. And he has a challenge for men: ""See if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper,"" Baldoni says. ""Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? Are you strong enough to be sensitive? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?""",2627,26.36,70.96,56.64,52.17,16.63,14.35,94.33,60.79,20.82,14.58,8.22,2.25,1.64,1.94,0.53,6.24,5.29,13.51,10.05,6.43,9.36,1.48,19.15,5.14,2.7,2.21,0.69,2.06,7.08,4.19,2.78,0.72,0.57,0.69,15.76,0.8,0.57,1.29,4.87,13.4,2.63,2.36,1.9,2.7,1.41,4.26,3.08,1.03,1.14,0.76,2.55,0.72,1.07,0.3,0.15,9.97,3.81,1.48,3.58,1.37,0.57,5.94,11.99,0.91,10.73,1.52,5.18,4.19,1.75,0.8,0.23,0.15,0.19,0.04,0.42,0.15,0.04,0.19,0.04,0,4.91,7.04,0.19,0,1.07,0.04,0.8,2.89,1.98,0.04,1.32,0.08,0.38,0.11,0,0.08,0,0.26,0,0.04,0.04,0.34,7.1,4.13,2.83,0.99,0.46,0.76,7.06,4.25,2.73,0.46,0.68,0.61,6.13,3.83,1.99,0.15,0.46,0.46,8.09,4.43,3.66,1.83,0.46,1.07,6.84,5.02,1.82,0.61,0.3,0.46,7.26,3.48,3.63,0.3,1.06,0.76,0.46,0.11,0.08,0.08,0.26,0.12,-0.1,0.22,-0.35,1.64,-1.99,2,3,4

Margrethe Vestager,"Commissioner for Competition, European Union","Margrethe Vestager wants to keep European markets competitive -- which is why, on behalf of the EU, she's fined Google $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules, asked Apple for $15.3 billion in back taxes and investigated a range of companies, from Gazprom to Fiat, for anti-competitive practices. In an important talk about the state of the global business, she explains why markets need clear rules -- and how even the most innovative companies can become a problem when they become too dominant. ""Real and fair competition has a vital role to play in building the trust we need to get the best of our societies,"" Vestager says.

Robert Muggah,Megacities expert,"With fantastic new maps that show interactive, visual representations of urban fragility, Robert Muggah articulates an ancient but resurging idea: cities shouldn't just be the center of economics -- they should also be the foundation of our political lives. Looking around the world, from Syria to Singapore to Seoul and beyond, Muggah submits six principles for how we can build more resilient cities. ""Cities are where the future happens first. They're open, creative, dynamic, democratic, cosmopolitan, sexy,"" Muggah says. ""They're the perfect antidote to reactionary nationalism.""",2756,78.54,62.13,56.07,19.29,15.48,18.76,80.52,49.31,9.11,4.54,0.62,1.31,1.12,0,1.49,4.57,7.29,14.73,7.95,5.62,7.55,1.23,14.11,5.95,3.41,1.74,4.21,3.66,3.34,1.45,1.89,0.29,0.18,0.44,6.39,0.04,0.04,0,0.04,10.09,1.31,1.85,1.34,2.14,1.05,3.88,2,1.27,0.18,0.44,0.98,0.15,0.51,0.04,0.29,7.87,1.74,1.63,2.76,1.2,1.02,1.63,12.26,1.27,17.45,2.72,11.14,3.92,1.85,0.22,0.22,1.05,0,0.18,0.15,0,0.04,0,0.11,0,6.31,6.79,0.36,0.07,0.15,0,3.23,2.98,0.22,0,1.72,0.11,0.25,0.07,0,0.83,0,0.14,0.04,0.04,0,0.25,3.4,0.87,2.53,0.43,0.29,0.58,3.28,2.04,1.24,0.15,0.07,0.29,2.74,1.44,1.3,0.43,0.14,0,4.06,0.29,3.77,0.44,0.44,1.16,2.93,1.76,1.17,0.15,0.15,0.44,3.61,2.31,1.3,0.14,0,0.14,0.36,0.07,0.04,0.83,0.18,1.17,-1.29,2.46,0.87,0,0.87,2,2,2

Nikki Webber Allen,Multimedia producer,"Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness -- they mean we're human, says producer and activist Nikki Webber Allen. Even after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression, Webber Allen felt too ashamed to tell anybody, keeping her condition a secret until a family tragedy revealed how others close to her were also suffering.

Natsai Audrey Chieza,Designer,"Natsai Audrey Chieza is a designer on a mission -- to reduce pollution in the fashion industry while creating amazing new things to wear. In her lab, she noticed that the bacteria Streptomyces coelicolor makes a striking red-purple pigment, and now she's using it to develop bold, color-fast fabric dye that cuts down on water waste and chemical runoff, compared with traditional dyes. And she isn't alone in using synthetic biology to redefine our material future; think -- ""leather"" made from mushrooms and superstrong yarn made from spider-silk protein.

Sara Menker,Technology entrepreneur,"Sara Menker quit a career in commodities trading to figure out how the global value chain of agriculture works. Her discoveries have led to some startling predictions: ""We could have a tipping point in global food and agriculture if surging demand surpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food,"" she says. ""People could starve and governments may fall."" Menker's models predict that this scenario could happen in a decade -- that the world could be short 214 trillion calories per year by 2027. She offers a vision of this impossible world as well as some steps we can take today to avoid it.",2254,64.13,63.88,63.79,37.55,15.13,21.52,83.1,50.71,11.8,5.1,1.33,2.48,0.93,0,0.35,6.7,6.57,13.22,9.18,6.21,6.79,1.24,14.51,5.19,2.22,1.86,2.66,2.48,2.71,1.69,1.02,0.35,0.27,0.18,5.9,0.04,0,0,0.04,12.24,2.66,3.28,1.11,2.44,1.24,3.19,2.09,1.73,0.13,0.22,1.46,0.13,0.13,0,1.29,8.03,2.66,1.91,1.95,1.02,1.02,3.02,11.31,1.46,17.04,2.75,9.67,4.66,3.19,0.04,0.09,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.08,5.24,0.04,0,0.53,0,1.2,1.73,0.09,0,0.4,0.09,0.04,0.04,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0.04,2.4,1.33,1.07,0.62,0.18,0.09,3.01,2.04,0.97,0.09,0.35,0.27,3.03,1.25,1.78,1.25,0.18,0.18,1.78,1.42,0.36,0,0.18,0,1.77,1.6,0.18,0,0,0,4.24,2.47,1.77,0.18,0.71,0.53,0.13,0.04,0,0,0.18,0.71,-0.1,0.81,1.22,-0.01,1.23,2,2,1

Teresa Njoroge,Criminal and social justice reform advocate,"In 2011, Teresa Njoroge was convicted of a financial crime she didn't commit -- the result of a long string of false accusations, increasing bribe attempts and the corrupt justice system in her home in Kenya. Once incarcerated, she discovered that most of the women and girls locked up with her were also victims of the same broken system, caught in a revolving door of life in and out of prison due to poor education and lack of economic opportunity.

InÌ©s Hercovich,"Sociologist, social psychologist","Why do women who experience sexual assault rarely speak up about it? ""Because they fear they won't be believed,"" says InÌ©s Hercovich. ""Because when a woman tells what happened to her, she tells us things we can't imagine, things that disturb us, things we don't expect to hear, things that shock us."" In this moving talk, she takes us inside an encounter with sexual assault to give us a clearer idea of what these situations really look like -- and the difficult choices women make to survive.
